                <h2>Info</h2>
                <p>The LetSurvivX is a world where I play with my friends and other players, all of whom contribute to
                    the server. One of the most notable features of the server is the village of Valoria, located at the
                    spawn point. Valoria is not just a collection of buildings and nature; it is the center of the
                    world, with several stores and establishments built by players. The stores offer an array of items,
                    making Valoria the perfect place for trading and resource gathering.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>Beyond Valoria is the rest of the world with some large and impressive bases that showcase the
                    creativity and dedication of the players. These bases are often home to smaller factions that form
                    and dissolve over time, each with its unique character. These groups bring an element of
                    unpredictability and excitement to the server, as they interact and occasionally compete with one
                    another.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>LetSurvivX isn't just about building and survival; it's also about community, a little bit of
                    storytelling, creating shared experiences and a little bit of a habit. Whether it's collaborating on
                    massive projects or engaging in friendly competition, often even just hanging out, every session on
                    the server brings new memories and makes history. It's a place where I meet my friends daily, and
                    I'm very grateful to be a part of that place.</p>
