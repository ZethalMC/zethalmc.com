      <h3>Founding of Eleysae</h3>
      <p>For a long time, Ze Alaric wanted to found a town, dedicated to Boaterism. A town where Boaterists would have a
        safe place, a haven. When he finally got to found it, he immediately invited his best friends, Jeremaeh and
        Harold, to join the town. They quickly built their houses in the center of Eleysae and inhabited them. This was
        the start of Eleysae. The safe haven for Boaterists was born.</p>

      <h3>Eleysae Church of Boaterism</h3>
      <p>There were plans to build the church of Eleysae for a long time, and some person, named Brend, started the
        building process, but he was not able to finish it. He sadly left Eleysae before the church was finished.
        Jeremaeh and Harold eventually built the church. This was, because Jeremaeh couldn't live with a half done
        church next to his house, so he tore it down. After that action, there was an empty hole at the place. Jeremaeh
        and Harold decided that someone had to build the church again, before Iristor would come and freeze the world,
        so they built the church themselves. On the evening of january the 27th, the church was finished and
        officially opened.</p>

      <h3>One Boat</h3>
      <p>This is the first book about Boaterism that Ze Alaric Thalos wrote. It is about a fictional person, Aric, a man
        who became a Boat and returned after from the afterlife, back to the world of the living.</p>
    </article>
    <hr>
    <article>
      <h2>One Boat</h2>
      <p>In the realm of Rathnir, Boaterism was an intriguing philosophy that intertwined deeply with the lives of its
        followers. Beyond its simplistic origins, it had grown to encompass a rich tapestry of belief and tradition,
        where the six types of boats symbolized different aspects of existence.</p>

      <p>Deep within the heart of a sprawling metropolis known as Fjörgyien, the Boaterist community had established a
        special place of worship: the Boat Tower. This grand structure resembles a tower of Boats. It stood as a
        testament to the diverse facets of life celebrated by the followers.</p>

      <p>At the heart of the Boater's Haven was a legend, one whispered only among the most devout. It spoke of a man
        named Aric, who had lived during a time when the city was plagued by darkness and discord. Aric, an ordinary oak
        boat maker, had dedicated his life to crafting boats of exquisite beauty and balance.</p>

      <p>One fateful day, as Aric set out to sail on his latest creation, he encountered a terrible storm that engulfed
        his vessel. Struggling against the tempest, he clung to his boat for dear life as lightning crashed around him.
        When the storm finally subsided, Aric was nowhere to be found, and all that remained was his boat.</p>

      <p>The boat drifted along the shores of Ironhaven, passed down from one owner to the next, each unaware of its
        extraordinary history. Years turned into decades, and the boat's wood began to age and crack, reflecting the
        hardships of the city itself.</p>

      <p>Then, on an ordinary day, as the boat sat in a humble workshop, its timbers creaking with the weight of time,
        an
        unexpected event occurred. A bolt of lightning struck the boat, illuminating the workshop with an otherworldly
        radiance. When the light faded, there stood Aric, not as a boat but as a living, breathing man.

      <p>The city was awestruck by Aric's miraculous return from the afterlife, and he became a living legend among the
        followers of Boaterism. He shared tales of his time adrift, where he had witnessed the hardships and joys of
        life from the perspective of a boat. His return was seen as a symbol of the eternal cycle of life and rebirth,
        where even in the darkest of times, hope could prevail.</p>

      <p>Aric spent the rest of his days in Ironhaven, crafting boats that bore his wisdom and the lessons he had
        learned
        during his time as a vessel. These boats were regarded as sacred artifacts, and those who owned them cherished
        the connection to Aric's extraordinary journey.</p>

      <p>Boaterism in Ironhaven evolved to include the belief that boats were vessels not only for transportation but
        for
        the human spirit itself. They symbolized the resilience of life, the enduring strength of the human soul, and
        the unbreakable bond between people and their creations. In Ironhaven, the legacy of Aric and his miraculous
        return continued to inspire generations, reminding them that even in the face of adversity, there was always a
        chance for renewal and transformation.</p>

      <h3>The Discovery</h3>
      <p>This is the second book about Boaterism that Ze Alaric Thalos wrote. It is about Harold Teutonicus-ad Alendir
        and Saunic Spud discovering the existence of Spirits inside of the Boats of the sacred Boat Tower.</p>
    </article>
    <hr>
    <article>
      <h2>The Discovery</h2>
      <p>In the world of Rathnir, a new religion was born, known as Boaterism. It revolved around the belief that boats
        were not just tools for transportation but, vessels imbued with spiritual significance. The six types of boats
        symbolized different aspects of the world, and their importance was central to this emerging faith.</p>

      <p>In the heart of Fjörgyien, a vast, picturesque city in the land of Sirradra, the Boat tower stood tall. It was
        the epicenter of Boaterism, a place of great reverence for its sheer abundance of boats. The tower itself was a
        symbol of restoration, for it was frequently destroyed and rebuilt by the devout followers who considered it an
        act of devotion to maintain the sacred structure. Each boat within the tower represented something unique. The
        spruce boats symbolized Priests and Heroes, honored for their wisdom and bravery. Oak boats were associated with
        the common people, representing the backbone of society. Acacia boats were dedicated to animals, recognizing
        their role in the natural world. Dark oak boats stood for monsters and mobs, embodying the challenges that
        people faced. Jungle boats celebrated the importance of plants, while birch boats were reserved for those who
        had transgressed the laws and were seen as criminals seeking redemption.</p>

      <p>Saunic Spud and Harold Ad Alendir were the founders of Boaterism. One day, while exploring the Fjörgyien Boat
        tower, they stumbled upon an astonishing revelation. Through their experiments, they discovered that every boat
        harbored spirits within them. As they delved deeper into their research, they heard a mysterious voice inside
        their heads, as if the very boats were speaking to them.</p>

      <p>'Finally, someone recognized our existence,' the voice echoed. 'We have been guiding the people for many years,
        even though they did not know. Please, give us the recognition we deserve. Spread our word across the lands, for
        we deserve to be praised!'</p>

      <p>Overwhelmed by this revelation, Saunic and Harold felt compelled to heed the voice's request. In a moment of
        divine connection, a sacred book descended from the heavens, containing everything related to the Boat Spirits
        and their wishes. It was their divine mission to share this knowledge with the world.</p>

      <p>Boaterism quickly gained followers across the whole province, Enithica-Novoros. The faithful gathered at the
        Fjörgyien Boat tower, where they worshiped, celebrated, and restored the sacred structure. They believed that by
        respecting and understanding the spirits within the boats, they could bring harmony to their lives and the world
        around them.</p>

      <p>The Enithica River in Hierapolis also held a special place in Boaterism. It was here that one of the faith's
        founders had found an enormous treasure. This discovery was seen as a sign that "what is the boat without the
        water underneath?" The river became a place of pilgrimage for those seeking blessings and a deeper connection to
        the spirits.</p>

      <p>Among the many spirits that Boaterism recognized, two were particularly notable. Knunkles Spud, believed to be
        one of the first boat creators, was revered as a founding ancestor. He was reincarnated as the spirit atop the
        Fjörgyien Boat tower, guiding and protecting the faithful. On the other hand, there was Bob the first, an evil
        sheep with unnatural powers. After one person, named Sir Sonic, killed him, he was reborn as a birch boat,
        instead of an acacia boat. This boat embodies the belief in redemption and transformation.</p>

      <p>Boaterism continued to grow, its followers spreading the teachings of the Boat Spirits far and wide. In
        Rathnir,
        the boats were no longer mere vessels. They were sacred conduits to the spirits that guided and protected the
        people. As the faith expanded, so too did the recognition of the importance of boats and the world they
        symbolized.</p>

      <p>However, as time flowed relentlessly forward, the fervor of Boaterism gradually waned. The once vibrant faith
        that had united communities and celebrated the spirits within boats began to fade into obscurity.

      <p>Among those who still believed, the spirits within the boats continued to speak to them, albeit in fainter
        whispers. Knunkles Spud and Bob the first remained symbols of faith, but their stories became more obscure with
        each passing year.</p>

      <p>Boaterism, the religion that had once promised spiritual connection through boats and their spirits, was now a
        shadow of its former self. Its teachings, once embraced by the masses, were now known to only a handful. The
        world had moved on, leaving Boat Spirits to quietly linger in the hearts of a few who still believed in their
        presence and power.</p>

      <h3>Spirits Vision</h3>
      <p>This is the third book about Boaterism that Ze Alaric Thalos wrote. It is about Ze Alaric Thalos seeing the
        Spirits, on the place that is now the Holy Lands. The town of Eleysae is built on the Holy Lands, and is the
        capital town of the Boaterists. The perception of Ze Alaric Thalos has ensured that he is now the Messiah of
        Boaterism.</p>
    </article>

      <h2>Spirits Vision</h2>
      <p>In the historical city of Libertalia, known for its thriving civilisation and bustling trade, a curious
        character named Ze Alaric had set out on an extraordinary adventure. He was going to restore Libertalia in it's
        former glory, as the city was in ruins, after a deadly desease killed all of the old inhabitants, and the city
        was disbanded.</p>
        <p>Ze was a writer by heart, and his travels had led him to the heart of the province Enithica-Novoros, where he'd
        heard whispers of the enigmatic Boat Spirits. These spirits were said to show themselves only to the Boat
        Messiah, and it was rumoured that they held the power to glimpse into the future.</p>
        <P>One night, Ze found himself wandering around in past Libertalia, and just looking at everything, as his eyes
        catched an odd light. It seemed to dance across a large empty field, but Ze didn't know what it was. He asked
        Sloan, his business partner to take a look, but Sloan didn't see anything. Ze decided to take a look himself,
        and he figured it were spirits. He began to approach the spirits, because he was afraid they saw him.
        As Ze approached, the spirits began to shimmer with an ethereal light. They had awakened. Their presence felt
        formidable and tranquil, like the calm before a storm.</p>
        <p>Ze bowed respectfully, realizing he was in the presence of something extraordinary. The Boat Spirits recognized
        his reverence and decided to share their wisdom with this intrepid writer and adventurer.
        "Ze Alaric," one spirit began, its voice a soft, melodious hum. "We see in you a seeker of knowledge and a
        wanderer of the world. You are destined to uncover the forgotten treasures of history and bring tales of the
        past into the light of the present."</p>
        <p>Another spirit continued, "In the city of Libertalia, where merchants and marauders alike converge, your path
        will intertwine with those who wear masks of deceit. Beware of those who offer power at a heavy price, for not
        all that glitters is gold."</p>
        <p>A third spirit spoke, "But fear not, for your journey will lead you to a guardian, a loyal companion who will
        stand by your side through trials and tribulations. Together, you shall unlock the secrets of ancient relics and
        hidden maps."</p>
        <p>Ze listened in awe as the Boat Spirits foretold future encounters and challenges. The spirits' voices
        intertwined like harmonious melodies, painting a vivid picture of the twists and turns that lay ahead.
        The prediction continued, "You shall bear witness to a clash of worlds and ideologies, as forces seek to
        redefine the boundaries of freedom and tradition. Remember, it is in unity that true strength is found, and
        through understanding, bridges can be built."</p>
        <p>The Boat Spirits, their ethereal voices carrying a weight of solemnity, continued their ethereal proclamations.
        "Ze Alaric," spoke one of the spirits solemnly, "we foresee turbulent times for those who stray from the
        righteous path. In the shadowy corners of Enithica-Novoros, the bandits Sir Sonic and SpecialWizard shall meet a
        fate unbecoming. Their actions will lead them not to honor or glory, but to a fate far darker. They shall
        receive the Birch Boat, a symbol of doom, a stark reminder that the course of their actions bears no
        achievement." The aura around Ze and the Boat Spirits darkened, casting a chilling pall over the field. Ze felt
        a shiver run down his spine as he absorbed the ominous prediction.</p>
        <p>Turning to more promising matters, the Boat Spirits continued, "On the brighter horizon, Saunic Spud, the
        founder of Boaterism, shall remain a beacon of hope and wisdom. His legacy will inspire generations, bringing
        unity and understanding in times of strife."</p>
        <p>"And High Priest Harold Teutonicus Ad Alendir." another spirit chimed in, "His devotion to our faith shall be
        unwavering, guiding the followers with unwavering dedication. His words will resonate like the tranquil ripples
        on water's surface, bringing solace to those who seek it."</p>
        <p>The spirits' light grew even more radiant as they focused on another individual, though with less intensity,
        "Lastly, Priest Biuco Spud, while his path may be filled with more shadows than light, his resilience and
        determination will forge a vital link between the faithful and the unknown. Through his trials, he shall unlock
        the secrets of balance and harmony."</p>
        <p>As dawn approached, the Boat Spirits began to fade, their glow diminishing. Their final words resonated in Ze's
        mind, "May you be shielded from harm, and may the spirits watch over you, keeping you safe from the storms of
        life."</p>
        <p>With those words, the spirits vanished, returning to their deep slumber. Ze Alaric left the field, his heart
        filled with gratitude and determination. He knew that his path would be filled with challenges and mysteries,
        but with the blessings and guidance of the Boat Spirits, he was ready to face whatever lay ahead.</p>

        On December the 26th, 2023, Jeremaeh had to be cured in the Hierapolis River, as he was corrupted by the flesh
        of Bob, a demon sheep. Ze Alaric and Harold babtized him, and he was sent to Flaitheas. Here, he was cured by
        the Spirits of Boaterism, and sent back to Thalamh. He still has signs on his body that reminds him of the
        event.
