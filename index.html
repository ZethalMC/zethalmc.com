        <p>Hello there, my name is ZethalMC. Most people call me Zethal or simply Ze. When I'm not travelling to college, or reading, you'll likely find
          me immersed in the world of programming, gaming, and exploring the fascinating field of AI. The languages I'm
          familiar with at the moment include Python, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Typescript, React and LaTeX. I love creating digital miracles, bringing things
          to life with code, and experimenting with artificial intelligence.
          <br><br>
          On the gaming front, my playground is mainly Minecraft, but also quite a lot of Hytale. You can
          catch me hanging out on Discord all day too, where I'm always up for a chat about really everything.
          <br><br>
          In the pursuit of my interests, I find beauty in perfection, symmetry, and neatness, although I'm not one to
          lose sleep over that. I appreciate order, but I'm not afraid to embrace a bit of chaos if it leads to a more
          exciting outcome.
          <br><br>
          As I navigate through college life, I'm eagerly anticipating the future and the opportunities it holds for both
          my programming hobby and gaming adventures. I'm looking forward to the insights and adventures that are
          waiting for me, even though my list of accomplishments is still evolving.

          <h2 class="mayor">Stoneworks</h2>
          <p>I have been an enthusiastic player on the Stoneworks Minecraft server, where I was especially active in writing,
            roleplay and developing lore, called <b>community
              storytelling</b>. I have been moderator for the server for almost two years. As a moderator on Stoneworks, I helped to maintain a fair and
            positive environment, to ensure players of a friendly environment on Discord, as well as in the Minecraft
            server.
            <br><br>
            One of my passions on Stoneworks was writing lore. I took great pleasure in developing
            history, culture and science. Additionally, I enjoyed creating stories for various guilds and corporations
            affiliated with Stoneworks, which I was sometimes hired to by people.
            <br><br>
            For me, the Stoneworks community was truly remarkable, for a very long time at least. It is full of creative and truly dedicated
            individuals, most of whom share a love of lore, art and role-playing. The events on the server were always a
            highlight for me. These provided opportunities for me to participate in large-scale roleplaying and, more
            importantly, to create new lore to write about. Being part of this community has been an incredibly
            enjoyable experience and I may eventually end up writing lore there again.
